# Things to be taken into account:

# Uncertainty in the center of gravity
# - Lower than usual due to cog trimmer

# Thruster misalignment
# - Lower than usual due to cog trimmer

# Mismatch of thruster outputs
# - Has to be considered

# Rotating machinery (pumps, tape recorders, etc.)
# - I dontt think we have any rotating machinery

# Liquid sloshing
# - Definitely has to be considered

# Dynamics of flexible bodies
# - Might be too complex to consider

# Thermal shocks on flexible appendages
# - Might be too complex to consider

# Rotation of TT&C antennas
# - Definitely has to be considered

# Rotation of solar panels
# - Definitely has to be considered
